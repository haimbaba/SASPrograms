386735	3	mar.	Page: residential complaints enquiry: last Friday (21/2/03) upon returning home, i found that my telephone service was completely dead. I attempted to phone ASTROCOMM faults on my mobile, but after wasting a considerable amount of time and then, finding that i would be faced with an up to 10-minute wait, i was not prepared to continue with a mobile call at full rates (i had already spent far too much time on the call as it was and it will be quite expensive). I was then faced with having to go to the nearest telephone box (1.5km) and the one where i thought i could phone was no longer there. Another 1.2km and i dialled the faults line only to be greeted with the same message about a possible 10-minute wait. As i needed to report this fault, i waited, and waited, and waited. I waited for 37 minutes, the connection rang twice and then dropped out! This is totally unsatisfactory. By now it was quite dark and i am not a young woman. The experience was quite frightening to say the least of having to ! !Stand in a public phone box with other people wanting to use it, being abused because of the excessive wait i had, and then, to be disconnected. I returned home, another 1.5km, and managed to find someone who would be prepared for a very long wait on the telephone to report the fault on my line. A technician phoned me back and informed me that my phone would not be repaired until at least Tuesday. Thats 5 days without a telephone. When i sought an explanation, i was told that he didnt have anyone in the area until Tuesday. Not good enough. I asked him what i was supposed to do until then and he offered to divert my incoming calls to my mobile as no cost to me, but if i wanted to make a call, it would be at full mobile rates - again not good enough. So, i spent the entire weekend without a telephone for which i pay rental in advance.

386783	4	mar.	Mr bob has rang to complain about a fault on his line that still hasnt been fixed after 3 weeks. When he reported the fault on his line in February he was told that somebody would come out to his place on the 13/02/03 and that he would have to be home for them to get into the house. Greg took the day off work to be there only to have nobody turn up. He rang that afternoon to find out what was going on and they told him that they would make the appointment for the 21/02/03. As per informed by faults he took yet another day off work to be there and they did not turn up on that day either, somebody finally turhed up on Sunday the 23/02/03 and connected the junction box to the wires. They told him that the phone was fine but when he went to use the phone there was that much static on there that he couldnt hear a word anyone was saying. Having reported that on the 24/02/03 a workman turned up on the 04/03/03 an hour later then what the appointment time was, the workman then proceeded to dig around the yard trying to locate the cables, after digging around for 2 hours he finally found them as the conjute was actually buried 1 metre underground and it had been bent to a 90 degree angle which has snapped the cable inside of it, upon seeing this the workman told mr bob that he could not fix it and that he would get back to him when he has worked out what he can do. Faults also did not give him a service guarentee for the 2 missed appointments, and mr bob believes that he should be intitled to it as well as be intitled to have the calls that he has had to make from his mobile be charged at lan line rates not mobile rates as it is not his fault he cant use the lan line.

386865	4	mar.	Customer sent email to cheif of business sales - it is only after a lot of frustration that i send you this note in regards to a problem that ASTROCOMM seem to have with single billing and i feel that someone at your level is aware of what maybe a real problem. It is in relation to a personal experience and nothing to do with corporate business. Last November when the service was advertised to change to single billing and receive a 10% discount on bundled services i personally applied for the service as i have 3 phone lines into our house, a mobilenet connection and astronet all with ASTROCOMM as well as cable pay tv. I thought the whole process would be seamless and painless. To date nothing has been achieved despite many (approaching 10) contacts with ASTROCOMM and something like 7 hours in elapsed time talking to ASTROCOMM staff. Every time we talk to someone they assure us that everything will be fixed and then we get another phone call or piece of correspondence that proves this incorrect. The problem appears to be that single billing exists as a theory in ASTROCOMM but there is no single contact point to deal with the issue. I have spoken to every department within ASTROCOMM and they keep transferring customers from one department to another with no satisfactory outcome. I hope you can forward this issue to the right person so that ASTROCOMM can improve what appears to be a basic business process flaw. I am purely bringing this to your attention so that something can be done to keep customers as the staff we speak to on the phone say it is not uncommon. Regards, doug sweeney0419996

387159	5	mar.	Customer was with optitel service provider. During our winback negoTIAtion with the customer, the competitor information supplied at the time only included summary information. There were no call patterns to be analysed. Based upon the typical call centre profile (short duration calls) & his gross spend, the most appropriate plan at the time seemed to be corporate advantage premium which was applied in May  2002. Customer signed up for recommended plan and came back to ASTROCOMM. Customer complained that pricing seemed to be higher than expected and billing were asked to identify discrepancy October 2002. As we now have the ability to analyse the customers call patterns it has become apparent that this pricing plan is not suitable. Greater benefit would be realised via the implementation of corporate advantage plus, due to the capped call component and untimed local calls.customer has requested the correct plan be applied and backdated to 24/07/02 until 11/12/02 based on corporate advantage plus pricing.

I moved house on 16th feb back to my parents house with my husband as my parents split up and the 60 acre property is too large for mum to look afterherself. As such i requested a second line for the house. I called inlate January to find out the procedure and was told it only took 5 daysso i called back on the 7th February and requested the line. At thistime i mentioned that it was a 60 acre property and was not sure whetherthe current line would be okay, but was assured it would all be fine.the new number was connected on 14th. To date i have not had a dialtone. I called back a couple of times the week beginning 17th to let them knowthe line was not working and a linesman (lee) was sent out to theproperty. He discussed it with my husband who was at home and told himthat the current line was laid under the ground not in conduit and thatthere was an existing fault 56 metres fron the house. He said that theexisting line was a ram-8 line and would not hold the second number ashe thought that connecting it would blow the existing line. As such hesaid that ASTROCOMM would have to arrange to have the lawn dug up and theline replaced. This would only take a week and he would arrange it - itwould not be at a cost to us. The following week, nothing has happenedso i called ASTROCOMM back again - they did not know about what leediscussed with my husband. Larry was then send out to the property on27th February and he came to the same conclusion as lee but i wasinformed this morning that it would take another 3 weeks. This is notacceptable.my husband is a full-time university student studying molecular geneticsand as such a lot of his work is research. He commences his final yearon Monday 3rd March.

387615	7	mar.	To whom it concerns, we recently received a bill from your company for ASTROCOMM astronet astronet service for the months of January and February (account number: 992026). During this period we experienced massive disruptions to our service. We continually had difficulty logging onto the server, and when we did manage to log on, we received constant error messages saying our connection had been lost. On a number of occasions this networking failure caused us to lose valuable data being transferred for work purposes. Also, due to the poor quality of your service, the disruptions meant that we were unable to use our download quota for February simply because we were unable to establish or maintain a connection. On our bill it states that we were given a 25% rebate for January for these problems. Bobever i feel that this is inadequate to compensate for the difficulties experienced during this period, especially as the problems continued through February. At this time i must say that i have been extremely dissatisfied with not only your service during this period but also your customer service. I do not believe that the rebate you have offered is sufficient, and needs further compensation in this case. The bill will not be paid until this matter is resolved.sincerely, simon waters.

387639	7	mar.	Letter to nixon roberts. Cust is in korea. Contact in koreai received your overdue notice today the 14 February 2003. There are two problems with this bill for $278.45.1. I have not yet received the original accounq. ASTROCOMM told me the first billing would be 3 months after the connection date and that the $209 connection charge would be included in that billing.for the record this is a new connection. The connection date was to be 07 January 2003 but ASTROCOMM could nof find villa 36. The links nautilus st, because ASTROCOMM insisted their internal address system be used which showed all existing phone lines at the links by lot number ( no arguement from me). Its hard to imagine you could drive past a multi-million dollar gold course development, but thats their excuse. After staying home all day awaiting the ASTROCOMM connection i contacted them from a foiling hot public phone and was told they would come back on the 17th of January. Much argument and insulting ensued with the result that they offered to bring the connection date forward to the 15th of January. I believed that a competent, caring consumer0focuessed organization would apologise for the error and offer to make good without delay. This did not happen so i am a very disgruntled customer.the people i spoke with were.and.(cairns).i would appreceiate it if you would sort this out and let me know as i am not expecting to pay the first account until mid-April or thereabouts. I trust that will be itemized ?note minor correction to the address on your notice.

387767	8	mar.	Jackie purchased a motorola 9500 on the 10/01/03 via msc (mobility sales channel). From the outset there were problems with the phone not reading the sim card properly (check card - displaying on handset) on the 26th February she sent the phone away to be repaired (it had only been used for 3 phone calls), and as it was purchased via msc, the phone had to go to the state repairer (in archerfield bris). On the 26th jackie called us (tms) to get the details of where to send the phone, and a consultant (jason) advised that the phone would be back to her within five days of sending it away. The phone was posted on that day, and jackie insured the phone, and attatched a delivery confirmation to the parcel so she would be advised that the phone had reached its destination. The confirmation was received back in bowen yesterday (06/03/03). Jackie called the repairer today (07/03/03) to see what was going on, and they advised that they had only just recd the phone today or yesterday. It was not yet in the computer system. This certainly was not the case, as the delivery confirmation had reached bowen yesterday. Jackies primary complaint relates to the misinformation given in regard to the timeframe for the repair job, and as secondary issue, the lack of quality in the handset in the first place. The phone was purchased as a means of emergency communication for a fishing vessel, and jackie feels that it has not even come close to accomplishing what it was bought for.

388094	11	mar.	Written complaint received at ASTROSERVE, as claims that since before christmas they have been receiving nuisance calls on their home phone and claims that the caller hangs up after the call is answered. Cust claims that he arranged for a call trace to be placed on his service. Cust claims that on 993 he contacted the scarborough and mirrabooka police stations, but claims that he was advised that as the calls were no threat of violence, them no crime had occurred and the police could not act. Cust claims that he was referred back to ASTROCOMM. Cust claims that ASTROCOMM allegedly advised him that they are only the provider and not a prosecutor and therefore cannot iniTIAte the next step. Cust therefore feels that as ASTROCOMM has the relevant information, it should be a fairly simple, mechanical and non emotional procedure to prosecute. Cust feels that he knows who is making the calls and feels that perhaps with this information, he may be advised of the simplest way to deal with this situation. ChrisTIAn.ASTROSERVE.

He also told me that if i agreefor it i would have to be under that plan for one year. At the end of conversation he told me also, that he is going to send me more information about it. With the information he gave me the more 4 you plan looked like a good offer so i agreed to change my existing plan for the new one. On Monday (right after i finished work) i rang ASTROCOMM to ask about the cost of the phone call (if it stays the same as in my old plan) and i was told that my calls in the new plan are more expensive. With this new information i realised that this change is for worse (bigger total cost and longer commitment) so i ask ASTROCOMM operator not to change the plan. I told her that i felt mislead and i want my previous plan back. I was told that i could cancel the new plan after paying $ 150.00 fee because i agreed for it and i could ask question before it. I believe that ASTROCOMM officer should give me all of the required information when asked about the catch (what the bad sides of the deal are: eg. Bigger cost per call). He didnt do so and i have a strong feeling that because of this unprofessional misguiding i should be given a chance to cancel the agreement without any penalty. A person from the customer service- allison or allyson (i rang on Monday24/02/03. Cont in notes
388238	11	mar.	Pat phoned reporting she had received a phone call from ASTROCOMM saying her phone line was restored, but when she used the phone her calls dropped out. She said her phone had been diverted so she took the diversion off and was having the same problem as orgininally stated. Pat said she was unaware that when the diversion was activated she was responsible for all of her outgoing calls from the mobile at mobile rates. She made a phone call to a friend who was in hospital from her mobile and believes that because she was not told, ASTROCOMM should rebate her for that call. I have reissued the fault & activated the diversion again. Pat is quite upset and would appreciate a phone call from complaints asap on or wk.

388245	11	mar.	Rcvd email, email adress:rbucbob@com.au : kana case number 9931: hi, i have received a rebate of 25% off my monthly plan, no explanation was provided, it was left to the national press to provide me with answers to ASTROCOMMs problems of late. Im also of the understanding that those who complained have received a 100% rebate, whilst my patience has been rewarded with no rebate and no explanation. I have had consistent problems connecting to astronet cable throughout the last two+ months. Attempting to connect often involves running the astronetconnect software up to 50 times until connection is finally achieved, or i give up and try again at a later date. This has been an ongoing problem which i hope your recent network upgrades have corrected. I wish to register my complaint at the level of service ASTROCOMM astronet cable has provided in 2003. Regards, richard ASTROCOMM username: rbuc

Even though the customer alleges that the lines were installed on that date and have been working since then the order # 99917 has been held since that date due to a lack of ASTROCOMM infrastructure. Customer can both make and receive calls on these services but is experiencing faults on two of those services and which suffer from interference and as the orders have not been cleared off as completed and were held his faults cannot be fixed until this is sorted out. Customer is very frustrated about this as he alleges that he first notified ASTROCOMM of this issue three weeks ago and claims that no one is willing to assist him.

388350	12	mar.	O/n /03/03 sarah surname23 ccentre - called the customer - cathie - cp: 0922 to advise that the current ced of the 26/03/03 was the best i could do - nns would not pull the ced in any further. Cathie was very angry about this because she had advised ASTROCOMM back on the 17/02/03 of what work had been completed and she knew that only a small amount of work (ie, hauling and jointing of cable) needed to be done to connect her (4) business lines at churchill street, as she is a ASTROCOMM contractor herself. Despite a site visit, nns did not acknowledge that the customer has been correct about the amount of work needing to be done until the 07/03/03 - some 3 weeks later. Customer is very disappointed and angry that it will take nns 6 weeks to haul and joint cable and the fact that nns. Should have known what they needed to do (to connect) with my first phone call. The original ced for the project was the 02/04/03 - this was changed on the 07/03/03 by nns to the 26/03/03 - only 5 days earlier. Cathie thinks that this new date is still unacceptable, given the nature of work that needs to be done by nns and the fact she explained this to ASTROCOMM over the phone (and when nns conducted a site visit) some 6 weeks ago.

388360	12	mar.	The cust has written the following email to our ceo:dear ziggy i have recently signed up with astronet astronet DSL and have been a lot less than satisfied. First things first.when the modem arrived, in the self install kit, it was faulty. It took bpa a week to finally agree and send out a tech whom confirmed it and replaced the modem. This means i had no service for the part of February that i was connected for. I believe i should be able to receive the 50% rebate on my bill for feb at least, because the supplied equipment was faulty ASTROCOMM bpa also advised me that they had a problem with the ip address pool assigned to my exchange. So this has resulted in connectivity issues with my service. This is ongoing and as far as i am concerned, still hasnt been fixed. When the service does work, web browsing is on par with the speed of a 56.6kbps modem dial up connection. This should either be fixed pronto, or i should be compensated for it. Ive checked and rechecked the equipment at my end, going to lengths such as reinstalling the operating system, trying 3 different machine with different configurations and operating systems, and like i said before, the DSL hardware replaced. I also signed up from the countrywide website, after a friend pointed it out and suggested i go ASTROCOMM for my astronet, and id receive a free webcam. I have yet to hear about this webcam, or see it. Id like to know what ASTROCOMM bpa is going to do about these issues. So far, for the money i will pay (when the bill turns up, and when the service is working properly) ive received a modem and a service that only parTIAlly works, and been promised a webcam i have not received. Thanks for your time and patience, i really dont like writing e-mail of complaint, but it had to be said, and best to go straight to the top rather than muck around with drones on the helpdesk whom simply say the same thing or shunt you from one department to another. Yours sincerely

We however are very disappointed to now find out that what we have purchased is by no means what we were sold. We wish to inform you that we find your advertising on tv, internet and indeed information given to us in person over the phone on serveral occasions regarding the guaranteed speed of internet isdn 64kbps misleading if not false. To quote from your internet site and product line information. Isdn home - break the internet speed limit my internet access is unreliable and slow, especially in the early evening. Can i do better? Yes! Isdn home provides guaranteed 64kbps digital speed-significantly faster than a standard analogue modem connection anytime of the day or night. Less waiting for you while you download large files or software updates. And its great for playing interactive games!

The proven reliability and speed of isdn home can remove these frustrating barriers, allowing you to work more efficiently while you spend more time where you want to be. At home.continued in notes.

388722	13	mar.	Compensation request for expenses incured. The customer has requested reimbursement for expenses incured due to having their router reconfigured due to ASTROCOMM removing allocated ip addresss & re allocating them to other customers without informing this customer.the customer is claiming it costs of $1190.00 based on work done to reconfigure the router.they had requested an upgrade of their tid service n9925r to 128k, but have found that some ip addresss they had programmed into their router were allocated to other ASTROCOMM customers. They are claimining reimburesment of the the costs of reprograming the router.i have investigated and found that the basis of the arguement is that ASTROCOMM did not inform them of the reallocation of the ip addresss and subsequently caused them to incur costs investigating and reprograming their equipment. I have also found that the ip addresss in question were allocated for service n9982r which was withdrawn as the distance to the exchange was to far to provide an onramp service and the ip range was taken back by ASTROCOMM as the tid service was not provided.

388727	14	mar.	Kana #9969 as usual ASTROCOMM has yet again messed up!! Pardon the language. What on earth is wrong with you people? Why is it necessary for me to always have to go through such nonsense of your staff not being able to get particulars correct. I took on a new mobile service with ASTROCOMM 7th feb. With specifics for my three accounts, internet, mobile, land-line to be billed on the one account. But has this gone through??? No no no you continuue to make errors, and bill separately. If you cannot get things right, why should i not go to consumer affairs and seek legal help to dismiss anycontract i have with you. You make life so unhappy, and yet one stupidly stays with you. You do not deserve the business. No wonder your shares are in such poor condition. Your management at all levels cannot cope with the business. I will now stop my credit card server, anz gold being able to pay you, as from now, and of course this is what i should have done in February. No, i should not have opened another account with you, but closed them all. I am disgusted by your treatment.bob tasman-smith.

Cust claims that the consultant allegedly advised him that the request to change the listing details was received from ASTROCOMM and therefore he needs to have the matter investigated, as to who authorised the changes to his white pages listing as claims that he has never given ASTROCOMM authority to change the listing.

Customer said he could only log on after 3pm and he couldnt even use all his usage. He wants the problem fixed once and for all.
388944	14	mar.	Basically what has happened is we needed a field appt to connect cust line. Tech went out but could not find the the lead-in within the boundry of the property (the reason order was held) so we advised cust to have contractor find or install lead-in (cust believes tech refused to do the work). Cust hired contractor to come and find lead-in which they did and they ensured it was intact, possibly they finished the connection of the lead in to the house or street because the service thenworked (possibly because the service had been auto-cated) and so conn went though once path was clear but without any exchange order for conn at that point of time in our systems. Bobt then called in concern to his appt as he was dis-satisfied with our techs. Because we had not conn the serviceas such in the systems we could only withdraw the order (which in turn disconnected the connection). The cust had been in contact with vodatel and its possible that they may have just taken overthe line before the withdrawl of the order, there-fore leaving an aaphone msg of disconnection. Problem has been fixed now as cust now has everything done for ASTROCOMM to be able to do connection cust wants it formally noted as he has been unsatisfied with the whole process. Kia complaints

389044	15	mar.	Call centre:mr smith had cable installed today, the technician went out there and installed everything, the customer noted that an amplifier was not installed as he had specifically requested one as he has 3 fox outlets. The technician had no evidence of an amp on work order. The technician left and then called about an hour later with an announcement that as the amplifier was in fact meant to be part of the order however as he did not have the equipment on hand, and would no be able to until Monday, he would have to remove all the installed equipment and return the earliest on Monday to reinstall from scratch. As the order could not be closed without the amplifier the, the technician was forced to disable the account in wizard and remove the equipment. The customer is furious, this is blatantly an error on our side and we are unable to at least leave his account connected over the weekend and simply return and install the amplifier on Monday. The customer is considering scrapping the service and going to someone else and is in disbelief that we were unable to help him.additional note:i attempted to communicate this with wmc but unfortunately due to work procedures was unable to get the account left active.the customer was advised that activations would pick up this open memo on Monday morning and complete the order, and organize a new installation date. Wmc have also agreed to flag the account so that this can be fast tracked, i did also recommend the customer contact activations himself on Monday morning to ensure this is prioritized.

389095	17	mar.	Mrs bobed to complain regarding the connection of her new service. She placed the order at the m/shop in runaway bay, spent one hour in the shop with the consultant. (order placed on 17 feb 02 by a female on the middle counter - no names on order). Consultant gave mrs bob an fnn, wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to her. ASTROCOMM then changed the fnn and did not call to advise her about the change. ASTROCOMM also disconnected her existing telephone service prior to the date she had requested. Mrs bob had given out her new number as a contact point, as she had hired people to help her clean the old premises. The people could not contact her, therefore did not come to help, and as the phone had been disconnected at the old address she could not phone them to get them to help. She cleaned the premises herself, and through the stress etc she had a stroke, for which she was hospitalised. Also, pension details not added, and std res not added to service, as requested. I have adjusted the conn fee to $27.50, adjusted calls by $6.45 for pens conc, and adjusted std call back to $2.50 as per std res. Asked cust what she would require by way of conpensation, she asked for $200, have agreed to this. Also advised i would send cato complaint to runaway bay m/shop for training. Cust does not require a phone call back from m/shop , but she said that she thought it would be more likely for her order to be correct if she went and spoke to a live person rather than call ASTROCOMM

She was advised at that point - that a technician had to come out to the premises to check on the lines and perform 0ther services that the customer required such as cable etc - which fast connect was also supposed to organise but hadnt. She was advised a date and time of when the tech would come out but the tech did not arrive. Mrs boben then rang ASTROCOMM back - and advised the tech did not turn up - so another appointment was made. 2 techs arrived on the same day and advised to mrs boben that there is not ASTROCOMM service available at all to their premises and that there never could be - due to the fact that when the house was renovated - all aaphone lines and cabling was connected to the service box at the side of the house. The techs then left and was not willijng to advise any further as they were not considered ASTROCOMM customers.mrs boben was left with no solution to not having a phone service. ASTROCOMM is now charging the customer a connection fee and monthly line rental for a service that they were advised the y could never have. Cust has been trying to get a solution to the billing prob since late jan and feels his last port of call is the ombusman. He has been advised that if the tanding amt owing for the conn fee is not paid - his syd number will be can. Cust is very angry and this situation has caused him much rage.

389205	17	mar.	Cust has emailed through the following complaint about the delay in the connection of a new service. Another contact number for mrs boby is 040. Please note that the rest of the complaint is in notes. Enquiry: on Friday, March 7, 2003 i arrived at my home/office that is currently under construction to meet the ASTROCOMM technician who was to connect a telephone line to my house between 8.00am - 12.00pm that day. This phone line was in addition to three other lines i had had connected on February 13, 2003 at the same property. The reason for the fourth line was that after being told by ASTROCOMM i could have cable, i was then told cable was not available. I was then told by ASTROCOMM that DSL was available, but then told we were on an integrated rim and that DSL was not available. By 1.00pm that day the ASTROCOMM technician had not arrived. I phoned ASTROCOMM and asked what time he would be arriving. I was told that the booking was actually between 10.00am - 2.00pm (not 8.00am - 12.00pm as originally told). At 2.00pm i phoned ASTROCOMM again to find out where the technician was - the lady said that she would have to phone through to that area and find out. After waiting on hold on my mobile phone for 10 minutes she came back on the line to tell me she was still on hold. I asked if she could phone me back as i was on my mobile to which she impatiently told me she would. She never phoned back. At 2.30pm i call ASTROCOMM again and spoke to another lady. That lady told me she would have to put me on hold and find out. I told her i was on a mobile and that she could phone me back - she called back about 15 minutes later to say the technician would be there shortly. I asked her what shortly meant and she said she didnt know. Perhaps half an hour she said. At 4.20pm that afternoon a ASTROCOMM employee phoned me to say that the technician would not be coming to connect my phone line that day. She did not offer any reason.

389371	18	mar.	Email recvd from cust on 993 disputing 190 internet dialler calls.to whom it may concern - re: account # complaint: your charge of $67.50 for 3 calls allegedly made from an internet dialler illegally installed on my computer, while i was not home to make such calls: September 24 - in perth working / September 27 & 28 - visiting daughter on south coast i am currently an horizon telephone customer, and was surprised to get a bill from ASTROCOMM last October. After investigating it at length, and trying to contact the offending company (mediatel: 90099050) without success (they seldom answer calls or emails), i obtained a local call record, as well as an internet connection report which i now attach. You will see from both attachments, that there exists neither any local call registration or charge on my optitel records, nor any dial-up registration or charge on my astronet isp report to the 1900 number for the offending dates. I therefore ask that you withdraw this charge. Thank you. Kind regards beare: bytebob@astronet.com(see email for attachments, forwarded to crg_inbound_sales)

389481	18	mar.	Correspondence recieved from the TIA level 993/991-1 about obtaining DSL service at the address i planned to move on 19 feb 2003 to his current address.he was told iniTIAlly that it would be possible to have an DSL connection at the said address. He needs to start using the service at his then current addres as there would be no problems with transferring the service at a later date for a fee of $55.00 he couldnt see any reason why he shouldnt install the DSL services at that address and using it, he agreed and used the service until 19 feb 2003. On the 21 feb he organise to transfer of the service to the new address. He spoke with various people and they ran a test of the phone line and the confirmed that he was able to have DSL at the new address and told him that once the line had the applicable code put on it, he would be able to use. And would recieve a charge of $55.00. The following mon or Tuesday the DSL is still not connected and he phoned ASTROCOMM again. And he was told that it will take four days to the service to be connected, he spoke with various people. He spoke with another consultant only to be told that the line could not accept DSL and when he requested a supervisor was told no one was available to speak to him.mr bobinson understand that he might not be able to transfer his DSL to his new address and under normal circumstances would be breaking his contract with ASTROCOMM.,but the issue is that he was specifically told that he could have DSL ad this address by so many people, and the reason he entered into contract was to have the DSL as this address. He doesnt believe taht he should have to pay early cancellation fees when it was clear that he was iniTIAlly lied to. He needs to know whether he can have DSL at his present address and if not he does not wish to pay ongoing charges for service they promised but can not provide.

Cust beleives he was given false information to convince him to come back to ASTROCOMM and needs to lodge a formal complaint about it. The customer says that if he cannot have the 5% discount applied to his total bill as an on-going concern then he needs his services reverted back to how they were before (ie being billed through aaphone).

389527	18	mar.	On advice of letter of confirmation from the priority customer group that if he had any problems to contact 990, he did so ( regarding an ongoing fault) using his mobile. They transfered him to the priority customer team. On receipt of his call he enquired as to wether it was a chargable call to his mobile. I advised if transferred from 990, yes, if he had rung 993 directly on a ASTROCOMM mobile it would have been a free call. He advised of his dissatisfaction with this and advised he would not be paying for the call as he had contacted the number he had been advised to and had to wait for 26 minutes before reaching me in priority. H e furhter advised in regard to his fault that a card had been left and it states for further imfo? Contact free calll 1800. But the service rep had not filled in the free call number thus giving him a choice. Mr bob wishes to advise he is a barrister and will follow this up to his satisfaction including exercising his choice to change to aaphone should it be required to make his point. A rebate of this call charge is requested to rectify the situation.

389550	18	mar.	Morrie is handling the accounts for stratos communications. Back in August 2002 morrie asked for astronet satellite account to be closed, member id# 9908, along with many other requests. Morrie was dealing with dora fotopoulos, account manager from ASTROCOMM. The satellite account was not closed and morrie was not advised by dora that he needed to get the account holder on the satellite account to call and cancel. Stratos communications account has been taken over by robyn muir who is now the account manager. Robyn has copies of the emails between morrie and dora with his requests. Morrie is disputing the satellite charges on the fleximax account, he is stating that they shouldnt be paying for the satellite account since August 2002 when he originally requested it to be cancelled. The satellite service has been used up until the 7th of March when i have now cancelled it after speaking with michael, the satellite account holder. Morrie is aware the account has been used but he is advising that if we had done our job originally and cancelled the service then it wouldnt have been used. Three satellite charges of $240 each have already been adjusted but morrie is requesting the 3 charges on the new bill of $240 each to be adjusted aswell. Morrie is not happy at all that this has dragged on for so long. His contact number is 0439989923.

389598	19	mar.	DSL accnt-9991. Email: ddabob@astronet.net applied on 04/03/03. Cust claims that sales advised they would have the self install kit by 5 working days after the application was put through. Cust says with this advice, he opted to apply for DSL. On 14/03 cust called to enquire how application was going. Activ8 advised cust still processing application. Cust was not happy that this was not done. Cust demanded activ8 send out the kit on 14/03. Activ8 explained to cust the process when processing self install application. Cust was not happy to wait. Activ8 explained that custs request could not be adhered to & would follow it up on 17/03. On 17/03 cust became very angry & wanted the application processed manually & decided to pick up kit via their own courier at their own cost. The account was created manually & the codes were jumpered at the exchange. However, the custs courier went to the warehouse to pick up the kit but waited for about 5mins & had to leave because they could not wait any longer. The cust called on 17/03 about 3.30pm very abusive & angry screaming becuase the courier did not get the kit. Cust demanded the kit be sent via express post & be at the custs premises by 9am on 18/03. Activ8 explained to cust that the lateness of the day could not permitt us to be able to do anything until the next morning. Cust still not happy. Activ8 looked into situation on the afternoon of 17/03 but had no luck. On the 18/03, activ8 called the warehouse to see what happened. The warehouse indicated they were busy at the time the courier arrived, but had the courier waited, they could have attended to him. Hence, activ8 organised for the cust to pick up kit again on 18/03. After much discussion with the cust, it was too late for cust to organise for a courier. The cust then demanded either he would pick up the kit & charge ASTROCOMM for his time or activ8 get him an afternoon appointment for a professional install & the cust will pay the difference in cost.pto

There is no life threatening medical condition and the situation is not dangerous so i have advised her that ASTROCOMM could not fast track her fault as advised by the help desk. I have activated a diversion from her phone line to the mobile, but that still doesnt solve the fax issue. I suggested that she takes her fax/ph to an alternative number so they can call there, but she said that it was too much of an inconvenience and she would have to drive a couple of kms down the rd to do that. She was prompted to put in a formal complaint as she had been requesting compensation off her next phone bill. She is expecting a phone call from ASTROCOMM and said that it is rediculous that she has to wait so long for her phone line to be restored and that she has to wait for a minimum of 48hours for the complaints area to respond. She threatened to go to the radio stations to report this incident.pls phone her on or the service number which has been diverted.

389641	19	mar.	*page: residential complaints*enquiry: your web interface for registration is a disgrace; it functions slowly and at the end of the day wont register clients correctly. I have attempted this twice and wasted at least an hour. I understand now why people dont bother trying to pay ASTROCOMM bills via the web. In addition, your company makes it incredibly difficult to do anything, either by web or by phone. What a pity there is no competition!!! Like this complaints form (or should i say series of forms) for example, which would take anyone half an hour to complete! Whats worse is that this email of complaint will inevitably fill a void somewhere in your worthless organisation, and will never be read, let alone lead to any improvement in your service. Time to try aaphone i guess

389646	19	mar.	Mr bober arranged a telecard for his daughter to take to italy. On 22 feb he accessed the t.com website and obtained the numbers to use in italy. He obtained 2 numbers- for italcable-9961 and idc. I have not advised customer that idc a japanese company. Mr bobers daughter went to italy early March and attempted to use both numbers from a payphone. She did insert coins into the payphone. Neither number would work and she was given instructions in italian to ring another number. The operator on that number was not helpful. Mr bobers daughter then rang bobovia using her mobile. Mr bober rang our centre on 15 March to check the access numbers, and was told by a very rude operator that it was now 992xxxxx. Mr bober does not have a record if he checked the idc number with the operator. Mr bober then emailed his daughter of the correct access number, but again it would not work. His daughter again rang bobovia on her vodatel mobile (), and now has a bill of over $220. Mr bober needs reimbursement of the costs incurred on the mobile. Mr bober has stated that when he rang to check the access numbers, he also asked for a user guide to be sent out. This arrived yesterday with the incorrect number for italy printed in it. I have advised this is due to the sudden change of the number. Mr bober feels that when numbers change an addendum should be attached to the user guides before they are sent out.

389793	19	mar.	Rcvd email, email adress: rbthbob@astronet.com : kana case number 9980: ssw 9921: i know this isnt the right division to complain to but i cant stay on line long enough to find the right division. I wish to make a complaint about the astronet service. It often takes five or six goes to connect to your server. Only to find it disconnects with seconds. Then when i am able to connect i cant use the web because it cant find the server. Tonight i have reconnected several times and i have had a gut full. And now it cant find the server. If this doesnt improve i will be going else where. If you are able to pass this onto the appropriate people i would greatly appreciate it.

On the same day another order was issued by mylie dantier but booked for 11/03/03. This order was for a can and a new (the new being a diversion straight from the exchange to his mobile (cdno). Mylie said she took this call from one of the companies employees, fleur higgs. Mylie tells me that fleur rang back in and spoke to a man and asked him to cancel this request on the same day. Instead of this person withdrawing the order there and then, he asked her to fax in this request on company letterhead. Of course by the time someone got hold of this, it was too late, the orers had gone through. Nick crawford then rang, not sure if this was still in relation to the phone diverting but got another consultant, di staley. Di worked out that the customer msut have wanted the telephone line connected back up to the premises so put in another order for a can of the cdno and a new for the connection back up. Instead of picking up an intact, the order was sent to the techs. The tech rng me and advised that this should have been an intact and of course between the cdno going off and the connection i can only assume it would have been a couple of hours, not sure as autocat did grab the exchange work at the same time. Di said she got the impression the csutomer didnt want to pay line rental which is maybe why fluer rang iniTIAlly to cancel the line and set up cdno only to later change their mind due to working out they couldnt use the line to make outbound calls. The customer claims he has lost a lot of business over all of this. He also wants a record of all faults on this line going back 3 yrs.

After reading the article in the smh http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/05/508.html i am not impressed with the way ASTROCOMM does anything, though i am sure everyone else in bobovia agrees with me on this one. You can call me and we will go through the problems i have had. Not too mention three days ago i had to call the technical department to get it fixed. Having them go through uninstalling my network card and various other issues, to not be reconnected. But to be told i had to pay for a technician to come out and fix it when its ASTROCOMMs fault the connection wasnt working. Then when i said no im not paying for it. Waiting for my rebate!

390282	21	mar.	Rcvd email, email adress:dleobob@lexmark.com: kana case number 9977: page: ASTROCOMM.com enquiry: re: astronet DSL - order no 9966 (danielle) i needs to make a formal complaint. I have recently had ASTROCOMM install DSL for me at home. I am very happy with the service, however i was mislead with regard to the installation process. I am computer literate and would have installed the software myself (saving $120), however i chose the professional installation option solely because i was told that this included extending my existing phone line to the required location (ie from my hallway into my study). I did not want to get under the house myself to do this, so i chose to pay the additional $120 for the professional install. Note that when i was talking to the ASTROCOMM sales assistant, i specifically told them that the reason i was going with the professional install was because i did not have a telephone connection in my study & i didnt want to get under the house myself, to extend the telephone cable. When the installation specialist arrived he said that to extend the cable under the house would be an additional cost at $88 per hour + materials. Therefore i have had to pay the additonal $120 (for professional install) plus in addition had to pay a professional electrician to come and extend the cabling under the house!!! I am not very impressed that i have been mislead as there is no way i would have chosen the professional install if it wasnt for the need to extend the telephone cable (as i am computer literate and have installed software/hardware previously). I believe that i am entitled to a refund of this additional $120 due to being mislead. (note that i have no problem with the professional who came to install the software - my complaint is due to being mislead as to what the installation covered) cont notes/actn.

390290	21	mar.	Rcvd email, email adress: wilkbob@astronet.com: kana case number 9929: ssw 9949. Original message follows: > ------------------------ > have you put my pricing up, as im sure i only pay around $24.00 all up? If > you have had an increase where was i notified? > regards mark wilkins. Well i filled out the notification for the 12 month contract at the $24.95 plan probably 6 months ago. Dont worry about the up-date as i am looking at changing my internet plan for both home & work over to another supplier, as well as my 3 mobile phone accounts, & my home phone line as well. I really cant see the value we are receiving, as we have had someone else look into our plans & given us advice that we could be nearly 50% better off by trying other companies - when you add up 2 x internet plans ($60.00 approx), 3 mobile phones ($300.00 on average), & home phone use ($90.00 average) - totalling ($450.00 per month), it makes more sense for us to change to other companies at maybe a cost of $225.00! I still dont believe ASTROCOMM have done anything that makes me feel like our business is appreciated. Sneaking up costs is one of the major down-falls, & i think it is about time we really considered saving money for the same product, & in some instances even better deals! Regards mark wilkins.

Rcvd email, email adress:lbob@astronet.com : kana case number 9927: ssw 9992: re subject: absolute dissatisfaction this is about my account with you, namelyASTROCOMM astronet account number : 9992 ASTROCOMM account number : internet & data services number: charged amount (incl. Gst) : $ 38.95my agreement with ASTROCOMM for internet & data services, number , is that if i open my service i am allowed to stay on for 5 hours, both for email and web scanning, and i do this daily gathering email address of research institutes and universities from web sites, and then using these email addresses sending them scientific information.seldom in all the times i use this service (sometime twice a day, 9 am to 2 pm, and then 10 pm to 3 am at night), does my connection last longer than 1-30 minutes - on average if i work for 5 hours i have to reconnect at least 10 times. It sometimes cuts off after entering only one web site (i might visit 10-30 in a session, picking up from 10 - 400 email addresses), also very often it cuts off within a visit to one web site. Sometimes i am able to send off of as much as 100 emails, but seldom, usually only about 1-10 before it cuts off (i do not have hang up when finished ticked off, and dont tell me my connections are incorrect or otherwise why does it work correctly sometimes (at least a few time it has stayed open for 4 hours when working at night from 10am - 1 pm; i always get cut off at 1 am in the early morning and have to reconnect).my dissatisfaction is two fold:* your automatic service apologises for this error, and regrettably says it is beyond their control. However, i then have to reconnect and have to pay for the reconnection - just this alone is costing me as much as $20 or more extra per month in phone calls. Cont notes/actn.

Mr f is upset with the delay his daughter experience when she requested that mobile service 04299xxxx be transferred out of her fathers name into her name. Cust disputes cost involved as well. Mr f states that he purchased the mobile service for his daughter on her return to bobovia, as she was not well.

After 45 minutes on hold and talking to various staff members the customer got no where with the t/fer, he states in his letter that a simple issue became difficult, he can not understand why. Cust request through the ceo office that ASTROCOMM now contact him to advise of the simplest way to complete the t/fer of ownership. Customer is asking for a speedy resolution to this issue.

The guys turned up on time to complete the install; however, they have encountered a difficulty with the line. I then received an unsolicited call not from ASTROCOMM, but transfield services to say that ASTROCOMMs install contractor had advised that i needed to pay for a ditch to be dug. Well i am not sure whether a ditch needs to be dug or not; what i do know, is that ASTROCOMM are trying to win back customers. I agreed to do this on the basis of information provided on the web link http://www.ASTROCOMM.com.au/switch/swhome.cfm and the terms and conditions for authority that you instructed that i read. I am eager to have the line installed as i need DSL for work. At present ASTROCOMM are eager to preserve this monopoly and i am sure that robert surname62, s, allan and would all be disappointed to hear of my frustration. There is no provision for ASTROCOMM to make a request that i incur any such fee in any of your promotional material or the terms and conditions for authority. The material is unambiguous as i interpret it, perhaps it is incorrect or misleading. Irrespective, there is no basis to lay any charge on me. I entered the agreement on the basis of the information provided and i expect that ASTROCOMM will honour the agreement without a need for me to raise the matter with the TIA. I ask that someone review my case and come back to me soonest. We have now gone beyond the 10 day reconnect service guarantee and so i needs this matter attended to promptly.

391193	26	mar.	Kana 9989 wizard this has really become a bit of a joke hasnt it - every day your service is down - not just occasionally but every day in response you offer 25 % off monthly bills - you seem to think that is the solution to keeping people happy only recently did i engage your service - most days i see your share price struggle or fall can you guarantee uninterrupted service or not. Please advise. We are running not only a business but we deal in family law and people in serious stress who need responses quickly when children are in danger or there is about to be a crime. I therefore need your immediate commitment to whether you can keep up your end of the deal or not. Please give me an honest answer. I do not intend to pay more than 25 % of your monthly fees until you remedy these problems. Bobase advise if you think thats unreasonable. I have also spent an inordinate amount of time and telephone cost contacting you each occasion you go down to establish if your fault or ours. I await your urgent responses

391221	26	mar.	Cust is not happy with the level of service that was provided to him when he tried to take advantage of ASTROCOMM/cable package. Cust booked on the 22/03/03 to receive cable and was told a tech would be out around 7am and 12. At 11.30 no one had turned up so cust contacted ASTROCOMM , who transferred him to cable. brendan from cable told cust someone had tried to contact them before 9am. Cust queried this as they were home the whole time. Brendan then chose, instead of attempting to fix the situation question the cust veracity.having already waited 1 month to get cable cust was quite keen to get it and extemely disappointed to be told the next appy was in a month. As far as the cust is concerned they had an agreement. They waited between 7 & 12 like asked and it was clear from brendan that cable werent interested in providing and kind of service on Saturday. Brendans manager later informed the cust as they were ASTROCOMM customers they should take the complaint with us.on Monday morning cust called ASTROCOMM and spoke to a donna whom offered no appropiate, timely solution to fix their problem. Coming from a cust service background cust was shocked by the apparent lack of interest to keep, not only their pay tv business but their phone business as well. Cust needs to know if he is dissatisfied with the response, to whom he can direct his complaint to ensure that the revelant people are aware of this serious problem. Cust would also a copy of all the personal information relating to their acct, including all the notes on their file as per the privacy act.

I needs to request that this area is updated to, not just new technology, but technology on equal grounds to the majority of sydney. I work in the it field, like a number of residents in my street and i know that the availability of astronet would be widely used in my area. The request for astronet was iniTIAted by a flyer i received from ASTROCOMM(addressed to me personally- quote reference number 1528), telling me i could save $100 off installation, and enter a competition where i could win an audi a3 if i connected, but now i am told i cannot connect even though i want to.

Mr bobd attended pitt street sydney and spoke to security after going to mobile shop.the matter was referred through to the TIA liaison group.his mother received the account issued on 17/3/03 and because of the notice advising her to contact ASTROCOMM (pensioner concession bill insert), she was advised that the account was still in her late husbands name. Mrs had contacted ASTROCOMM in April 2000 (not too sure of the year) and provided the appropriate death certificate - it appears that the billing name was changed only - not the account.as a result the service was disconnected and reconnected and she now has 2 bills to pay that overlap each other with service and equipment charges. Also, it appears that there is no pensioner concession rebates on the new account.

Often when we have called to report the problem we have been told it was our problem not ASTROCOMMs only to be told at a later date that it was a ASTROCOMM fault but we are always told to say it is your problem by an operator. It became such a serious problem i personally escalated the problem to danni team leader - server complex and jodie manger - server complex just so i could get someone to have someone accept there was a problem on your side. This has not only cost my company time and money but has also caused our reputation in the face of our clients to be damaged. The reason we put in the service was to ensure that we would have a continued and reliable service this has however never been the case. I do realise that no service is fail safe but with all the problems that my business has encountered with the service and the promise of a continued service from ASTROCOMM i believe i am entitled to compensation for the lack of service. I received a message from your service stating that due to a small outage that your customers encountered for the month we would receive a 25% discount( i am yet to see an adjusted invoice) with this in mind and the problems my business has encountered you would agree that there should be a consideration for a substanTIAl credit to the account. Attached is the disconnection messages which we have recor

391875	31	mar.	September 2002 p1 dealt with this customer by the name of rod burrows. He has a company called hire it pty ltd and has approximately 12 or so mobiles on his single billed phone account. The number he has these mobiles single billed to is. Nevertheless the problem is that, when p1 spoke to him way back then, they organised for him a more for business group plan with all the mobiles (through a proforma that was sent through to bizone). He called me in October/ November (i cant remember when exactly), and informed me that apparently that instead of going on the appropriate more for business plans, he was placed on a individual 20plans. Obviously he was done wrong in a big way, as alot of his mobiles were hardly used and those that were used were used fairly heavily. Hence not being on the plan we iniTIAlly agreed upon, and not being on a group plan he received a high bill. Apparently a credit was given at the time for some amount for his inconvenience by bizone, and the relevant plans were then set in place through another proforma that p1 sent through upon bizones request. Cust called back recently. He called to say that he was charged way too much and wanted to seek some further credit in order to resolve this blunder. He also has stated to me that he was not too sure of how he is being charged for the single bill that he gets, as he says that he gets charged for the mobiles individually itemised and also for a mobile account as per mentioned on his bill (to which he needs clarification on this matter, he says there is no breakdown justification for the charges). Further more he says that he thinks the call rates he now gets on his group plan is now more expensive then previously before. Apparently he says that in September he was being charged 40cents/min and now he says its 58 cents a min.

She lives alone with her 4yo daughter, is on a pension, and many of the calls were sex numbers in addition to calls to kalgorlie, mobiles, other std etc. She was apparently told that the calls were stemming from her account and she was liable and her phone would be cut off if she did not pay.> > not able to get around it any other way she had to start paying off the bill (this has also meant that her 4yo has had to go and live with fiona mother as she could not afford to feed her!!).> > the salvation army have also paid $200 of the $900 bill.> > as she continued ringing ASTROCOMM telling them it was not her bill and also informing of payments she was making to ensure her phone was not disconnected she at one stage asked for it to be disconnected to incoming only plus emergency numbers. She claims ASTROCOMM refused to do this. When this happenned she then requested an std and mobile bar which was put in place. Last Friday when she rang testra to advise of further payment she was told she now had another bill for over $700 (only $17 of this is local calls she has made - the remainder was made within a week before the barr was put in place).> refer notes & actions for the rest of the email received from the mp`s office

Dont you have a record of our down times recorded in your system so that you can look at our history and assess accordingly. With all ASTROCOMMs technology - im very sure that you have instruments recording malfunction/faults in the system. Or is it a case of ASTROCOMM just hoping that most people will realise how difficult it is to deal with this many headed monster and give up. Im just so fed up with being held over a barrel by the system. ASTROCOMM is very quick to disconnect us if we are slow to pay but it (ASTROCOMM) is very slow to admit wrong on its side. I paid my last bill on a Friday and on the next Wednesday they disconnected me for not paying the bill. I had clients who cared about the bad name being caused to my business, take the trouble to rush into my office to advise me that i had been disconnected. And the message given to callers was that we had been disconnected. I have never, never had such treatment from optitel. I absolutely hate ASTROCOMM with a vengence. Ann

392673	3	apr.	Frank kelly [kelbob@yahoo.com]thu 02/10/20099:52 amdear sir,i have recently been informed by another disgruntled customer of astronet that there is an excessive scam perpetrated by your company against unwitting customers, who are deceived into huge bills by concealment of information by astronet. Having joined your astronet scheme and being advised which price group was likely to suit me by your employee, we subsequently had exremely high bills due to exceeding quota. When i questioned the useage i was told that it was probably due to the use of music downloads (by my children). I accepted this and told them to rreduce their useage which they did. But still the useage accumulated. When i again phoned to complain i was advised that it was due to other people sharing our music files. What i was not told was that i could put a stop to that immediately by taking it off sharing.not being able to afford the increasing bills, and being angry at lack of assistance from astronet, both by phone and email, we bought our way out of the scheme very reluctantly. I believe that it was the responsibility of your experts to have advised me how to overcome my problem and it seems apparent that your company had a policy of not doing so. Consequently i feel that i am unwilling to pay the outstanding claim as it should never have been there in the first place.

Cust notices on his bill since July that all calls to that number are being charged.3. Cust claims he did not receive any notice of the above change and contacted 991 to determine why. 4. Cust claims he was informed that bus plans do not provide for this & was advised that he does get a cheaper call connection of $0.17 in lieu of a $0.20 fee. Based on further calculations (refer to letter) cust hardly believes it is a saving. Cust feels that ASTROCOMM has given the incentive and taken it away again. The customer feels that he is at a stage where with the matters raised above and poor coverage at many locations he is tempted to change service providers given the results he is seeing from ASTROCOMM.

My initial problem has fixed itself within 24 hours with all services nowbeing listed. However there are ongoing problems which i, and other users, now experienceas a matter of course with the ASTROCOMM billing and payments site. Some of my account numbers:account: account: account: account: account: the ASTROCOMM bill payment site performance is appalling. Slow to downloadpages. Impossible to download complete service summaries (they must be doneservice by service). Constant crashes. Inconsistent performance. I may spendten minutes allocating calls to find that the site crashes and doesntrecord the allocations. I then have to re-allocate and hope that anotheASTROSERVEash doesnt occur. This happens 50% of the time.when adding contacts or updating contacts my success rate is only 25%. Againconstant crashes and re-entering.we use multiple computers and sites (frame relay/DSL/dial up) to access thesite and have the same problem - whether using win2000 or winxp - the mostrecent version of internet explorer or not.if ASTROCOMM expects customers to use online payments and billing in lieu oftraditional paper bills then major site improvement/upgrade is needed tohave site working efficiently - as users we waste a lot of time trying toutilise this ASTROCOMM service which is imperative for our business.the potenTIAl of the ASTROCOMM site is enormous and should be benefiting mybusiness enormously. I hope my feedback is useful and improvements imminent.yours sincerely robert tarasovmanaging directorrotary offset press groupdirect: telephone: [+699] 9764-0210

Customers fax advises as follows:back prior to the end of 1999 i worked part time as a masseur & accupuncturist at . At the end of 1999 the building owners decided to convert the building into apartments & asked all the tenants to leave. To which i complied & as part of the move to where i subsequently had a new number installed (so its not like ASTROCOMM didnt know where i was) i had cancelled two of the lines & kept one (the main number which was in the phone book) for diverting inbound calls to my new number.at the time there were two amounts being sought in conjunction to the three numbers in question which were 99555, 99405 & ?, as worked out by myself & a ASTROCOMM manager in claims dept, for some reason the one of the lines was not disconnected when it should have been & kept accumulating service fees of $20 per month but as can be seen had no usage charges (which was because the building was being gutted & every one had moved out), this total being the $105.00 in question. He stated that he would correct this as he could see that was probably human error & could see no calls had been made nor could have been as the builing was being gutted.the second bill in conjunction with these numbers that was in question totalled about $190 to which we worked out that i was supposed to have paid but as the bills were being sent to 422 collins st they never reached me, & of course when i finally was confronted with it could not understand why or where this had come from, as i believed i had fully paid up all accounts. We did work out that it was outstanding & i promptly paid it. This leaves only the $105.00 claim that i still reject. & ask for your understanding & action in this matter. Should you required more info i will endeavour to supply it to you.

Dorn i have checked my mobile phone charges on the internet yesterday and was surprised to see a large number of mobile originated sms message charges that we did not make. I rang 991 at about 7:00 am and spoke to mack regarding this error and he made a note on the account and asked me to ring back after 8:30 am. I rang back at 11:10 am and spoke to kelly who then went over the same details. She then put me on to rebecca who called the mobile resolutions group who said they would look into it. I do not know why i even rang back and spent 15 minutes waiting when i was no further ahead with the inquiry. The problem is this: at 9:40pm on the 17th of September 2003 your system starting billing my account for one or maybe many, sms messages to 9947. The charges continued, with my account being debited 8 times a minute for a period of nearly 6 hours, up until 3:18 am on the 18th of September 2003. This amounts to about 2,700 sms message charges, totalling $681.84 to the same number. We did not send these messages, nor did person whose number is displayed on the bill (9947) receive this/these messages. Could you please arrange for our account to be credited $681.84 as soon as possible. Could you also please explain how this could have happened and what you aim to do to prevent it happening again? It has somewhat destroyed my confidence in the overall accuracy of your billing system. Please contact me on 2967 (during business hours) if you have any questions or problems doing this. Yours faithfully  like to be contacted: yes-phone email address: contact phone: 2967 name: .

393554	9	apr.	Customer sent a letter to the stating the followingin April, 1997, i purchased a mobile telephone through myers of melbourne formy ownpersonal use. This telephoneworked quite well and was a phillips which hadmy number as. I was signed up for a schemewhich i believed to be two years. I am surprised to realize that this scheme was still being paid in August 2002. Please provide to me details of this agreement further, in May 2002, i commenced having difficulties withthe phone andwas told by the local teistra shop that i would needa new battery which would cost $90.00. There was no attempt to test the telephoneand i was further advised that it would be better to purchase a new phone. I accepted this reasoning and after constant difficultywiththe phone i arranged though teistra to subscribe to a new scheme using one of the new typecdma sets. This commenced shortly afterward witha new number. I still havethe older phillips, which by the wayis working quite well and has proved normal.the new phone worked quite well until feb/mar 2003. On going to the local teistra shop iwas told i needed a new battery andthe cost was to be $75.00. I naturally expected that the warranty would cover the cost. I wasthen told that the warranty was only for 6 months on the battery, which seems to be a very short warranty on a batteryworth $75.00. Certainly, after the previous one lasted four years. I commenced checking the voltage in the battery and found that it was in fact charged to 4.78v but the phone still failed to respond. This indicated tome that the problem was withthe phone, or otherwise required an overcharge to make it respond. Afhrther request for help only offered a battery for $50.00. I was dissapointed and as i was expected in melbournefor a wedding, i went to another supplier and was provided witha battery for a much lower price, which at first seemed to work and then failed likewise.

393665	9	apr.	Ex-graTIA request input by account manager, garry wainwright.hugh reilly real estate recently had an DSL service installed. They had considerable problems with it as they were trying to get it networking and at the time no one had any expertise with the then new surname49 modems. As a result they had a router installed by nqbe to replace the modem at their cost. They believe they should get some sort of credit from us as they do not want the surname49 router from us. As an expression of good will i ask that we credit their account $150.00. The nearest i can tell we charge up to $189.00 in the installation fee for the modem. They billed just under $99.00 last year so i dont think $150.00 as a good will gesture is over the top.

393693	10	apr.	Rec email kana case nunber9982 wiz acc 9970 username drewbob@astronet.com.aui wish to complain about the fairly abysmal state of astronetDSL email over the past week or so (it would have been pretty well wiped outfor at least two whole days during that period). At the time of writingthis (1300 on 09/10/2003), we have had only one emaildelivered since about 8pm last night,whereas we should have had a dozen or more (newsletter subscriptions;confirmation of share trades etc). When i first looked about an hour orso ago there was no fault indicated on the astronet DSL network status site,apart from a few people having login problems in wa. The network statussite now says that a few people nationally are having email problems and theystarted about 1000 this morning, but i would say that it would have been wellbefore that. Obviously i cant say definitively what emails i haventreceived yet, but normally i get at least one email from the financial reviewat around 8am every morning. When i phoned up to report the fault the guy wanted to knowmy id/email address, which is fair enough; plus my password, which i thoughtwas a bit strange. His initial reaction was that there was no problem,but when he tried to log on as me, he agreed that there was an emailproblem. He also wanted to know the account holder name, plus my name,(which again is fair enough), but also my date of birth!. I did give it to him,but what the heck it has to do with confirming that there was a problem isbeyond me. He did helpfully suggest that i try webmail, as he assured methat that would be working, but subsequently when i did try it, i got the messagethe page cannot be displayed. I guess by now you might gather that im somewhat unimpressed.

S ee below details for complaint.since commenceing with astronet, i have hadan enourmous amount of problems with the modem (alcatel 530) dropping out ofsync. This has resulted in many hours on the phone (on hold) talking withyour technicians who have been trying to find the fault. Eventually i hadescalated the issue, having had enough. This resulted in 2 weeks ago, yourtechnician came to the house to test the line, 3 hours later, he told me mymachine needed re-building (he commented that all computers needed thisevery 3 months) and that was the reason that it was falling out of sync.having just had the m/c re-built only 2 months earleir, this did not standwith me, but he had deleted files from my computer without my authority andnot only that, left me with no internet either. Due to work commitments i was only able to get this resolved last week andmy technician spotted what was wrong straight away, ASTROCOMM had not set thenetwork settings correctly and i immidaty gained access.the down side is 1 hours work of $155 and up to 30 hours of my time in thelast 3 months, needless to say the missed opportunities as i was booked fora conference call the evening your technician came and as such, was veryembarasing to say that i could not refer to their presentation via theinternet when this is my business.i appriciate what you have done for me in the past but consider this needsto go to the top now. I am out of pocket by some $4000 based on what i havehad to pay and also my loss of time and i will be taking this matter furthertelling the whole story.in this regard, i would appriciate if you could forward this or tell me whoi should contact to minimise any legal correspondance that i will incurrshould i need to take it this far.kind regardspaul budgeon

394023	11	apr.	Cust rng to find out why all services at their office were disconnected. Turns out there was a request put forward from mission bobovia to optitel to disconnect these services. Optitel then sent the request to ASTROCOMM who put the orders through. At this point it should have been noticed that mission bobovia is not the same company name as key training centre nor was the person from mission an authorised rep on key trainings account. There was a change of lessee done months ago to move the mission services at bridgewater from missions name to key training. Key training had nothing to do with mission bobovia then. The customer also lost their DSL service when the disconnections occurred. I rang for chris oshannesey at horizon who was a contact on the ASTROCOMM order. He was not there so i left a message for him to call me urgently to find out what had occured and why. At this point i thought if vodatel had cancelled the services then they could have reconnected them. He did not call me back though so i rang again. I finally got hold of chris who gave me all of this detail and suggested i call ASTROCOMM on. I spoke to laura there and explained the situation. While i was talking to her there were some orders loaded into our system to reconnect the lines. I explained to laura that this should not have occurred and it was her responsibility to follow up the orders and the DSL. I wanted to keep on top of them anyway and as it turns out luckily i did as the services did not get connected by 12.10pm as they were meant to. I rang product connect and asked them to get on to getting them connected. After many phone calls, calls to the customer i achieved this. I alsl followed up on the DSL and ensured this was reconnected also.the customer is upset this occurred. He said he has lost business and wants to be compensated for this.

If so, disregard it. This customer installed an applex server in December. Apple uses port 99 ? As its http port, not port 80. The customer claims that the excessive traffic was accessing his unconfigure port 80. Apple has no way to block port 80 from being used. The customer has lodged a fault with apple on this issue but is getting nowhere. Apple is working on a software fix for this currently. The customers case is that once he discovered the problem he got an it person in who changed his setup. He installed a squid server which allow him to deal with this issue. The customer claims that this was a new service in July 2002, and from that date to December 2002 is normal data use. Since the apple software was installed, his traffic levels have gone up.

394837	16	apr.	Customer has numerous complaints and it starts with a complaint 2 years ago. Customer moved out of the address 9 surname were she had phone number connected with her husband. They then seperated and susan moved out leaving the phone number left in her name in york. Mr bober remained at the address and paid the accounts whilst in her name. Susan rang 2 years ago to get it taken out of her name but was advised she would need to disconnect which is policy and reconnect in his name.due to worrying about him not having a service she left it alone and he rang and was advised he would have to go to mobile shop with lease and id. He did not do this so it meant phone was left in her name all these years. Susan then rang in July to get her phone connected at new address south perthwith phone number on order 99067. This order has many complaints associated with it 1) customer susan should have been a silent line 2) customer asked specifically to have seperate accounts not joined to her old account number. Both were not done. In affect the old number she had in york had been billed with her new number and sent to her ex mr bober. The customer is currently in court with him over the seperation and is furious that ASTROCOMM disclosed her information eg: calls made and the number on the bill due to it being associated incorrectly. Customer now wants accounts flagged with seperated couples and wants sc coached. Sc does not work here anymore and if the number was originally disconnected by her and left for her husband to reconnect then this would not have happened. Due to leaving the number on in her name it has meant that the bills were joined together and caused this problem. We have changed her number and created new accounts for both. The October acc which has both of them on the account has had all her call charges removed off that bill and he is paying the remaining amount.

394921	17	apr.	Written complaint received at ASTROSERVE in regards to an offer that she claims she received from ASTROCOMM allegedly stating that from 993 she could receive bulletinboard and calling number display for the price of one. Cust claims that she therefore rang a consultant and claims that it was confirmed that she could receive the offer on her phone and therefore claims that she agreed to the offer. Cust claims that she has however been charged for two features and claims that she has not received the two for the price of one offer. Cust claims that she therefore rang the billing enquiries area and claims that she was advised that the offer did not apply to her service. Cust however claims that the letter which she received clearly stated that she was entitled to the offer and claims that this was also confirmed by a ASTROCOMM consultant. Cust therefore feels that she should be re-inbursed for what she feels were over payments and feels that she should receive the offer that was allegedly made to her. ChrisTIAn.ASTROSERVE.

395015	17	apr.	TIA level 1 complaint 03/991 cust rang ASTROSERVE referred by the tio, as claims that on 993 he made a call through global gossip to the czech republic, but claims that without his authorisation the call was overridden to ASTROCOMM. Cust claims that instead of being charged at a rate of 19.5 cents per minute for the call, he was allegedly charged at an approximate rate of $1.23 a minute through ASTROCOMM. Cust feels that it is unacceptable that he should be charged at a higher rate than what he had thought he would be charged when he made the call to the czech republic. Cust therefore needs to have the matter investigated, as feels that ASTROCOMM should be notifying customers if they are about to be overridden on an international call and feels that the call which he has been billed for should be charged at the rate that he was going to be charged when he initiated the call.

395068	17	apr.	Mrs bobes cld back today to discuss her ongoing problems with her internet connection.mrs has reported many times and has been shoved back & forward between ASTROCOMM and interworx, who is her isp. We have done molds tests etc and cannot find a line fault at all. Since February problem has worsened to the extent that she rarely can access the internet to actually do anything. As soon as she gets in to the internet and then tries to download email or access a site the whole thing drops out. As if as soon as there is a load put on the line then it shuts down. We discussed the thought that it could be an isp problem and she agreed to try to load astronet and i have sent a disc to her.she tried toload but without much success. She then had her neighbour come and get her whole computer and take it to his house. There they logged on successfully to astronet so they tried interworx and logged on successfully and used the net for 99/2 hours with no problem at all. Mrs is now convinced that the problem is a fault with her line. Perhaps it was intermittent at first but she now cannot log on with any amount of success.the problem has been existing since February and there are many handshakes since this time. Cust wants problem fixed (she is on ssoc) and on last bill alone there were 161 handshakes for which she has been charged a local call all less than two minutes. There are also calls for molds testing and tech testing which also need to be rebated.i have advised that i will escalate problem and that someone will be in touch with her

Up to last week i have been generally happy with the service astronet supplies. But your reply to my enquiry (below )is a blatant lie and i feel astronet is treating its customers like imbeciles. I like many saw the item on the 7.30 report last night (abc tv) where the ceo of astronet admitted the system had been infiltrated by a spamming virus - please dont try to tell me the problem is due to service upgrades! I am extremely disappointed with the way astronet has communicated to customers about this issue. I appreciate with the internet there are issues out of your control but i a) expect my service provider to be as secure as possible and b) to let me know what is happening - two day delays in send and receiving e-mails are just not acceptable but if i had known this then i could have tolerated reverting to fax or mail while astronet sorted the problem. But no information meant i missed deadlines, became frustrated and generally more pissed off with astronet. The arrival of the response message just enhanced those feelings rather than improved them

395390	20	apr.	Astronet astronet DSL, a/c # 9963, username rmagers, email: robynmabob@hotmail.comreceived email below, kana case # 9949i needs to lodge a very strong complaint about my switch to ASTROCOMM for astronet, phone and cable. I signed up for the three service package in September and it is only now coming to fruition. Cable has not yet been signed over to my knowledge. The main purpose for my grievance is that last Tuesday a technician delivered all of your merchandise and told my son that until our account came online we would not be registered as users. His name is david parry. He showed my son how to use the service and took him to a few places. By the time our account came on line on Thursday last week, it had already gone over our limit and todate i am up for 1.8gb on a 1gb plan. I have just upgraded to a 3gb one, because i cannot afford this incredible hike in what i was told was a trial to see how the system worked. I believe that when my account came online i should have started with a 0mb usage.in addition, i was told that ASTROCOMM would email me when our account started to go over its limit. Well this is my other complaint. 5 days later, i am still not connected to outlook express as the technician did not help with any of this. He actually crashed one of my computers which took three days to fix and reload. I have spent numerous hours trying to set up things from a few written codes given to me by your technician. If this is service, i hate to think what other consumers are experiencing.i need help to get this email system up and running. To my knowledge you have also this address as a secondary email account and perhaps you could use it. I have no notification from you and thus your end of the contract is definitely not met.i look forward to hearing from you.my telephone number is 9129 - which you should already have. Robyn magers

395408	21	apr.	Astronet dial up residential, member id 9976, username pats7, email: pbob@astronet.comcustomers email below, kana case # 9973my question is, what is ASTROCOMM going to do to recompense me for the loss of my main means of communication for the past two weeks? I am a laryngectomee, which means i have lost my voice box to cancer and am unable to speak normally. Consequently i rely on my email service more than the average person, as it is not just a matter of picking up a telephone instead. Some emails have been getting to me anything up to 10 days after they were sent, from right here in brisbane, where i live! This is a ridiculous situation and it is still going on today, as i have received no email when i know there is some in the system somewhere. You say you will give all subscribers 2 weeks free, big deal, what about the upset and isolation i am suffering at your companys expense? No doubt you will take your time answering my email, if ever that is. Patricia harper

395607	21	apr.	Jeremy had an DSL line installed in September 2003. When horizon service provider went to the premises to hook his DSL up they couldnt locate the line. Jeremy rang ASTROCOMM and the consultant that he spoke to said that as far as they were concerned the line was connected and active, then proceeded to say that there was nothing else that they could do for him. Jeremy rang his isp back who again went out to the premises along with their own linesmen and still they could not locate it. Jeremy called ASTROCOMM again and the consultant that he spoke to was really rude and beligerant to him. The consultant told him that it wasnt her job to track down his lines for him, that she wasnt going to send a tec out there to find a plug and that he would just have to look properly himself. Jeremy located a person whi used to be a linesman and he found the line and tracked it back to the mdf, he said the line was definately faulty as there was a lot of noise on it. A fault was eventually found in the exchange but jeremy had the line insatlled for a month before he could use it. I was unable to locate notes in any of the s/p databases, fleximax or alpha to show which consultant it would have been that the customer dealt with. Jeremy was not sure which number he had dialled to try to report the problem.

395702	22	apr.	Rec email kana case number 9994 home acc 9935 now closed username crazyspacbob@astronet.com to whom it may concern my name is rhonda and my user name was crazyspaceman. I changed from my old isp to astronet to take advantage of the ability to package my phone/cablel/internet together. From my first connection to astronet i was only able to access web pages for approx 10-15 minutes before i would receive the error message this page cannot be displayed. During this time the control pannel advised that i was still connected to the interent. Doing the right thing i contacted the help desk who made me check a number of settings within my browser. All setting proved to be correct. I contacted astronet tech support a total of 4 times over a 1 month period & was constantly asked to repeat this process even though it had not helped. I was asked to reinstall my browser and modem driver which i also did. Ultimately i found the service to be completely unacceptable. Now i understand that the cause of my system not being able to download pages was not the result of an astronet error but the level of cust! ! ! Omer service on the tech support line was dreadful at best. I have restablished my internet connection with my old isp who when i experience the same issue and explained my calls to astronet imedately advised that i install some virus software. I did and lo and behold i had contracted the w32.welchia.worm. A rather nasty bug. I was able to download a pach from my virus software providers web site and i ran it on my computer. Wait for it. Problem solved. Now i guess you are wondering where this is heading. After seeing the channel 9 news and the report about astronet i felt it my duty to call and let you know about the solution i discovered for my problem. The person i spoke to was completely disinterested after i revealed i had severed my connection to astronet. Not only was she rude but
395704	22	apr.	Rec email home acc 9938 username ka.bob@astronet.com kana case number 9946i am writing to convey my disappointment with the way ASTROCOMM has decided to handle the problems with email delivery - 2 weeks free access. I pay $28.95 a month and two weeks free access of this (approx $14.50) is no compensation for the inconveniences i have experienced - one costly one is my wage is delayed since the details i sent via email were received late and this was before the problem was made public. I rely on email due to my hearing impairment so it has caused a great deal of inconvenience professionally and personally, and i feel the way ASTROCOMM has responded has been unsatisfactory. The offer of firewall etc does not compensate for the problems occured and i am currently happy with the protection i already have. I have been happy with the service up till recently and disappointed in the way it has been handled; i am seriously considering terminating my account. Customer would prefer email response as is hearing impaired

396263	24	apr.	Rec email home acc9975 username thegillbob@astronet.com customer thank you for your message dated 9 October 2003. I did respond to you on 11 October , however the message would appear not to have been received by you as ,once again, i was logged off!! Soon after that our local telephone exchange went down (in the middle osf sydney) for two days and, since then we have continued to have problems with continually being disconnected when attempting to send messages. Heaven only knows what my bill will be this month. I would therefore be delighted if you would pass on my comments regarding the technical support survey previously sent to you. I see little point in attempting to call them myself because nothing will happen unless i agree to pay $14.95. My apologies for assuming that i would receive the same level of service from your organisation that ASTROCOMM continues to demonstrate towards its customers it is intersting to note that, to date, they have still to respond to my letter of complaint dated 25 September. Seems to be a case for the telecommunications arbiter on my return from holidays. Yours sincerely george an angry astronet customer

396498	25	apr.	Fax received from neil cato as follows:account number - cougar internet accessthank you for taking the time to discuss our dilemma. As directed, i will endeavour to recap the situation as best i can and how i understood the events. I needs to apologise for the delay in getting back to you. I have been madly searching through our records for supporting information but have come up with very little. As my memory serves me, the issue arose when i contacted ASTROCOMM to inform them that we had not received a special services bill for serveral months. It was then discovered that for reasons unknown, the bills were being posted to the wrong address. They had been sent to po box 997 wollongong east and there was no explanation as to how this came to eventuate. When we received copies of the outstanding bills there was another issue that we spoke to ASTROCOMM about and that was the billing plan. It appeared that the billing had been modified to bill option 2. We were always very careful with the selection of the billing plan and from what i can see the error was only relevant while the billing had the wrong address. When i spoke to a gentleman at ASTROCOMM regarding the payment of the outstanding amount he was going to attempt to calculate the amount that should have been billed rather than what had been billed. It became apparent that this was too hard and he suggested that if we pay $3000 he would have the remainder cleared. Payment was drawn and we never received any further bills or reminders stating the outstanding amount so our assumption was that the issue had been sorted and that the monies paid had cleared the account (until now).what i needs done is to have the bills calculated at the correct amount based on a usage fee rather than the capped rate that was charged somewhere through this debacle. Thank you for your time and i look forward to speaking with you again soon.regards

396627	25	apr.	Dr gurrguis has a clinic opening on 1/11/03 and ASTROCOMM recommended isdn to support the telephone operations in the clinic. An isdn enhanced was connected on 18/9 on advice from ASTROCOMM however it appears that this is the incorrect technology to support the digital phone system which the clinic has purchased. It appears that a standard isdn2 would have been the appropriate solution as there was a phone system involved not the isdn2 enhanced. Due to this error, only one channel has been linked to an analogue phone bypassing the phone system and causing exceptional inconvenience as the practice needs to be fully equipped with effective telecommunications on the date of opening (1/11/03). Dr gurrguis requires that ASTROCOMM urgently address this matter and arrange to have the correct system set up in order for the phone system to operate effectively.

Astronet astronet cable account, # 9966, username ldug5115, email: ldugbob@astronet.com.aucustomers email below, kana case # 9900this compensation by no means makes up for what it cost me, i rang your technical support on a number occasions for this particular problem and one night spending a great deal of time going through everything with a member of your group, he could not help, and advised that my computer was at fault and i needed to call in a computer technician , which i did, which over two visits cost me $140 and $110 =$250 only then to find the fault was coming from you. At no time when i spoke to your technical support did they advise me that your e-mails where having a problem, for if they had i would have known it was not my computers fault and spent $250 which i can not afford. I find this very unjust, i sent two fax to complaints department, these were ignored, patience can only be expected if you are upfront from the beginning and we do not spend money thinking it is our computers problem. I expect help lesley duggan

Customer had been contacted by one of our outbound areas to check if wanted to change over to astronet and went through the benefits of astronet with the customer, who agreed that it was a good option - however after the whole process of filling forms, installation time being provided was called back after a week and advised unable to have astronet as not available at the exchange. On the second instance he was contacted by a door knocker who came to the customers door and checked if he needs to have astronet and customer advised of his earlier situation, and the door knocker checked and advised the customer that no the exchange has been upgraded and he could have DSL definately. He sat down and noted all the requests that the customer needs for astronet, the customer clearly communicated to the representative that he has two computers and would need to use both the computers at a given time and both are situated at different rooms. He presently has dial up connection and has a second line for the internet with an extra socket at each of the rooms so he required the same set up with the faster and always on internet. The representative did not discuss any need for networking or advise him that he would need to check on that prior to connecting up astronet. Once the representative left he found that the form was not very clear with the plan chosen 10 gb or 500 mb hence his wife called in to confirm and whilst talking got into the conversation of networking and found that the solution provided was not going to help with the way the computers are set up. He was happy that his wife understood and hence could work out prior to the whole connection going ahead and the techncian advising him that networking is not possible. He is annoyed with the false expectations provided to him. He advised that the representative was not professional either in his presentation either, had to utilise the customers phone to make an outgoing call.

I needs to complain about the way my email account has been handled by ASTROCOMM. I have not received any email to the following address  since the 9.10.03numerous people however have contacted me and said that they have sent messages to this address.this email is used as the central contact for agricultural services branches for pricing issues.due to the failure of the email system our business has not been able to keep up with potenTIAl changes to pricing and any other correspondence thatcould effect our business on a day to day basis.the time that the email service has been down is totally unacceptable. I also find it unacceptable that it is so hard to find out from ASTROCOMM when the problem will be rectified.i spent forty minutes on the telephone on the 20.10.03 waiting to talk to someone to find out what is happening with the system. When i finally did get through to someone the only answer they could give me was that there were still problems.the only way that i have been able to start to communicate again with email is to have this new address set-up. I have now had to email all of the people i usually deal with asking them if they could resend any emails that i have not received in the last 14 days. This has also rendered useless my current business cards and any other correspondence i have sent to customers with my old email address. This could potentially result in lost income. I have not been given any assurances from ASTROCOMM that i will every receive the correspondence that i was supposed to receive over the last 14 days. Again this situation could potentially have lost us substanTIAl income.i believe it is unacceptable that ASTROCOMM has taken so long to rectify this situatio

I tried to access your free spam/virus filter - that was supposedly offered as compensation for your disastrous email service failure associated plainly with the launch of this product and the incapacity to deal with the swen virus. I guess these things happen, but when i am offered something for free i object to having to give a credit card number - especially over the internet with a carrier who clearly cant guarantee security. So i sent an email - this after some fruitless attempts to solve this by logging onto your ASTROCOMM.com site ( but thats another story). I received an e-mail from a technical rep. - david - asking me to call 992 -which i did. I first was routed among three different operators on this line - each with the obligatory retelling of the story, each with no solution and each with a varying length queue to actually get connected. The final result was i was given another number and got lost during the reconnection. I tried the next number and again was shunted around ( only twice ) to eventually be told - after about 50 minutes ( today and probably a further 30 minutes previously) that i had to enter my credit card number or not have the free service - and i have to say the operator verged on the rude in his curtness in telling me. Why it took 5 operators and 50 minutes to be told this is a mystery worthy of she

You chase us relentlessley when were a little late in paying the bill but when you dont perform u want our sympathy. It works both ways so get your act together and put your money where your mouth is. Ie i want 3 months free access. ASTROCOMM is a big company and this is just unacceptable. To send this half baked apology just shows me how pathetic your company is. I have a small business and if i stuffed up my business the way you have id be no longer in business. So spare me the bullshit. Privatise ASTROCOMM, youve gotta be jokin.
397487	30	apr.	Astronet astronet cable account, number 9971, username rogellen, email: rogebob@astronet.com.aureceived email below from customer, kana case # 9993this is a complaint not a suggestion or a request for technical assistance. It is sent by this section because i was unable to find another way to email my complaint. After installing the free trial security software offered in the recent email from astronet i logged onto our ASTROCOMM webmail account and sent a message to rogebob@astronet.com.au our home email address. When the first message (testing (1.95kb) sent at 2.40pm on 28 October had not been received by 6pm i logged back in and sent a further email at 6.06pm (testing sending from webmail (1.95kb)) to our home email address, my husbands work email and my work email. If i had been able to email this complaint i would have attached copies of both emails to verify the dates and times. The second email (testing sending from webmail) was received by my husbands work email account at 7.40pm on 28 October. This morning, 29 October, i checked our astronet account and found that the email sent 2.40pm on 28 October had been received at 1.42am on 29 October. Throughout the day i checked for the second email. As i was not at work today or yesterday my out of office was set. I have just checked our emails again and found that my out of office has arrived and that the email, sent at 6.06pm was received by my office email at 6.07pm yesterday but that it took until 9.30pm today, 29 October for the out of office to reach our home astronet account. The email sent to our astronet account did not arrive until 9.34pm. Both these instances would indicate that the delay is in receiving mail into our astronet.com.au account. Fortunately, i have not need to use email to contact anyone a business or urgent matter over the last few weeks but this is a far from satisfactory service. Yours sincerely suellen m petrie

Originally held 18/9/3 with ced 14/10 then slipped on 9/10 to 28/10 then slipped again on 29/10 to 14/11.the communication between surname30 contractors and ASTROCOMM is appalling.

He was repeatedly sayuing to sue and the builder your not understanding me and getting very upset. Sue then got her electrician in to look at the wiring and nothing was wrong. When the local ct came on Thursday he confirmed that nothing was wrong and completed the connection. Sue also advised that after the original ct left on Tuesday, some change was made at the exchange and the interim service went off. She then called her case manager jo and she sorted that out straight away. Sue is concerned that she did not know why the ct was there Tuesday, or where he came from. The ct didnt introduce himself or identify himself in any way, but he was driving a ASTROCOMM van, and did climb the pole out the front to do some work. Barry (local ct) said that here is a team down from toowoomba, and can only guess it may have been one of them, but does not know. Sue wanted somebody to know how this person acted while he was at her premises, as it is not what she has come to expect from ASTROCOMM, as the local ct barry is always very good.

Mrs smith has advised that she requested a coin tin replacement and was advised that a technician would need to attend to replace the tin and that a fee for service would be applicable, she remembers stating to the consultant that the process of having a technician attend to replace the coin tin seemed to be a ridiculous process but agreed to the technician attending. Another incident has occurred and coin tin replacement was once again required and mrs smith phoned through and was transferred to the payphone sales area and mrs smith was informed that she should not have been charged for the replacement of the other coin tin. Sales transferred mrs smith to payphone faults area to lodge this complaint to request the initial report be investigated.

397663	30	apr.	Rec email kana case number9930 usernamewendywabob@astronet.com homa acc9930thank you for your response - but of course this does not help the fact that i have missed some extremely important emails and 2 weeks refund certainly does not make up for the inconvenience!!!!!!! Why do some email messages come thru and not others? Seems like the important ones are bounced and the insignificant ones are not. As the uni has a firewall and state of the art antivirus, i wonder why i have not received many of these ones. I am extremely disappointed with astronet as my service provider at the moment (as previously explained being an external uni student means my interaction is via email only - pretty difficult when i cant receive many emails). And again, 2 weeks refund on my astronet account certainly in no way makes up for the inconvenience
397666	30	apr.	Customer initially called in to check when her service would be restored as it was reported on Sunday 26/10. I advised mrs bob that a serviceman had attended to the fault this morning at 9am and as there wasno one at home a card was left. Cust was not happy about this at all and explained that everyone in the home works and cannot wait at home. I told her that if we had a contact number we could have called someone and perhaps made alternate arrangements to call out later in the day as the customer works 60kms way, she lives in an isolated area and mobile reception is limited. I also explained that we have no direct contact with the serviceman as she wanted me to ring him to see what information was on the card. I told he cutomer that she needs to check the service on her return home and the card and if the service is still faulty i explained to the customer that in areas such as hers the serviceman do sometimes work outside of their scheduled working hours in order to get the services restored. The customer was not happy at all with any of the explainations that i gave her and requested that i lodge a complaint for her. The customer said that she gave a contact number on her original report - i advised her that this is part of the consultant compliance so she would defineately have been asked for and alternate contact number but none was given.
397669	30	apr.	TIA level 1 complaint 03/999 cust rang ASTROSERVE referred by the TIA in regards to international calls that she claims they have been billed for.

Cust claims that they have been advised that it may be possible that these calls are internet dialler calls, but cust claims that they have never authorised to be charged for accessing a particular site via the internet.
